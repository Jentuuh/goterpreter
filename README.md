# Goterpreter

A simple interpreter for the Go programming language that I wrote for my compilers course. It supports basic functionality such as arithmetic, for-loops, if statements (conditional branching), function calls, recursion, types (currently only int and bool), type return values and parameter return values. A demo program called `demo.go` which demonstrates some of the functionalities is provided in `/src`.

## Building and running (Linux, MacOS or Windows WSL)

To build, simply download this repository, navigate to `/src` and run the command `make` in your terminal. You can run the demo program with `./goterpreter "demo.go"`, or feel free to try it out with your own Go programs.
